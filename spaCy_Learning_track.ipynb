    "- Before we get starting with explaining how, it's worth taking a second to ask ourselves: Why would we want to update the model with our own examples? Why can't we just rely on pre-trained models?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Statistical models make predictions based on the examples they were trained on.\n",

    "   2. Predict a few examples with the current weights by calling nlp.update\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's look at an example for a specific component: the entity recognizer.\n",

    "\n",
    "Entities can't overlap, so each token can only be part of one entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the entity recognizer predicts entities in context, it also needs to be trained on entities and their surrounding context.\n",

    "\n",
    "    (\"iPhone X is coming\", {'entities': [(0, 8, 'GADGET')]})\n",

This is especially useful if you want to improve categories the model already knows, like \"person\" or \"organization\". You can also update a model to add new categories. Just make sure to always update it with examples of the new category and examples of the other categories it previously predicted correctly.

    "**Best Practices to Train the spacy Models**\n",
    "\n",
    "When you start running your own experiments, you might find that a lot of things just don't work the way you want them to. And that's okay.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training models is an iterative process, and you have to try different things until you find out what works best.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, I'll be sharing some best practices and things to keep in mind when training your own models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at some of the problems you may come across.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:1 Models can forget things**\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical models can learn lots of things – but it doesn't mean that they won't unlearn them.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're updating an existing model with new data, especially new labels, it can overfit and adjust too much to the new examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if you're only updating it with examples of \"website\", it may \"forget\" other labels it previously predicted correctly – like \"person\".\n",
    "\n",
    "This is also known as the catastrophic forgetting problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent this, make sure to always mix in examples of what the model previously got correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're training a new category \"website\", also include examples of \"person\".\n",
    "\n",
    "spaCy can help you with this. You can create those additional examples by running the existing model over data and extracting the entity spans you care about.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then mix those examples in with your existing data and update the model with annotations of all labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:2 Models can't learn everything**\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common problem is that your model just won't learn what you want it to.\n",
    "\n",
    "spaCy's models make predictions based on the local context – for example, for named entities, the surrounding words are most important.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the decision is difficult to make based on the context, the model can struggle to learn it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The label scheme also needs to be consistent and not too specific.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, it may be very difficult to teach a model to predict whether something is adult clothing or children's clothing based on the context. However, just predicting the label \"clothing\" may work better.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution: Plan your label scheme carefully**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you start training and updating models, it's worth taking a step back and planning your label scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try to pick categories that are reflected in the local context and make them more generic if possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can always add a rule-based system later to go from generic to specific.\n",

While we focused mostly on training the entity recognizer, you can also train and update the other statistical pipeline components like the part-of-speech tagger and dependency parser. Another useful pipeline component is the text classifier, which can learn to predict labels that apply to the whole text. It's not part of the pre-trained models, but you can add it to an existing model and train it on your own data. In this course, we basically accepted the default tokenization as it is. But you don't have to! spaCy lets you customize the rules used to determine where and how to split the text. You can also add and improve the support for other languages. While spaCy already supports tokenization for many different languages, there's still a lot of room for improvement. Supporting tokenization for a new language is the first step towards being able to train a statistical model.\n"
